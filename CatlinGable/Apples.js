// APPLES - 150 pts.
// In need of community service hours, you volunteer at your schoolâ€™s cafeteria.It recently
// received a large shipment of apples of various brands.Your task is to sort the apples by brand
// into baskets.Each basket can only hold 10 apples, so you must allow several baskets per
// brand.You are wondering how many baskets you need to hold all the apples.
